# Flow Timer: ADHD-Friendly Pomodoro

A specialized Pomodoro timer designed for people with ADHD, respecting hyperfocus and flow states while providing helpful time tracking.

## Features

- **Flexible Timer System**
  - Starts with traditional intervals (25 min work/5 min break) but allows continuation
  - Visual indication of elapsed time without forced interruptions
  - Option to manually end a session when ready for a break
  - Tracks actual work/break durations for later analysis

- **Non-Disruptive Interface**
  - Clean, distraction-free design with accessibility considerations
  - Visual time tracking that's noticeable but not disruptive
  - Color transitions to indicate time status (green→yellow→orange as work time progresses)
  - Progress visualization that doesn't demand attention

- **Customizable Settings**
  - Adjustable default work/break durations
  - Customizable notification preferences
  - Visual theme options (light/dark/custom)
  - Option to enable/disable specific features

- **Analytics Dashboard**
  - Visualization of actual work/break patterns over time
  - Insights on productivity cycles and optimal work periods
  - Export functionality for personal tracking

## ADHD-Specific Considerations

- Reduced visual clutter and distractions
- Clear but gentle state transitions
- Positive reinforcement for completed sessions
- No punitive messaging for extended sessions
- Respects flow states rather than interrupting them

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Customize your settings (if desired)
4. Start your first session!

## Usage

### Timer View

The main timer view shows:
- Current time remaining (or excess time in flow state)
- Progress ring that visually indicates time elapsed
- Simple controls to start, pause, or skip to break
- Session counter showing completed sessions

### Key Behaviors

When a work session timer ends:
- The timer DOES NOT interrupt you with forced popups
- Visual state changes subtly (color, animation)
- A non-disruptive notification appears that can be easily dismissed or ignored
- Time continues tracking as "extended flow state"

When you manually end a session:
- You're offered a choice of break duration or to skip break
- The actual session duration is logged
- The next session timer is prepared

### Settings

Customize:
- Work and break durations
- Visual notification preferences
- Theme and appearance
- Sound notifications (off by default)

### Analytics

View:
- Comparison between scheduled and actual session durations
- Patterns in productivity (best times, longest flow states)
- Actionable insights based on your data

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with CSS variables and modern layout)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Chart.js for data visualization
- LocalStorage for data persistence

## Accessibility

- Color combinations suitable for color blindness
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Adjustable visual theme
- Reduced motion option
